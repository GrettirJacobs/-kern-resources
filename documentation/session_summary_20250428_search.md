# Session Summary: Search Implementation

**Date**: April 28, 2025  
**Focus**: Implementing search functionality for the memory system

## Overview

In this session, we focused on implementing search functionality for the Kern Resources memory system. We implemented three types of search: vector search, tag search, and dual search. These search capabilities enhance the memory system by providing multiple ways to search for memories, from simple text search to more advanced semantic and structured search.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Vector Search Implementation

We implemented vector search functionality in the `MemorySystem` class:

- Added the `search_vector` method to the `MemorySystem` class
- Integrated with the existing `VectorSearch` class from the `creative_lab.memory_system` package
- Implemented support for similarity threshold filtering
- Added functionality to return full memory objects with similarity scores

### 2. Tag Search Enhancement

We enhanced the tag search functionality in the `MemorySystem` class:

- Updated the `search_by_tag` method to support tag queries in the format "tag:value"
- Implemented relevance scoring for tag search results
- Added sorting by recency for tag search results

### 3. Dual Search Implementation

We implemented dual search functionality that combines vector search and tag search:

- Created the `DualSearch` class in the `kern_resources.core.memory.dual_search` module
- Added the `search_dual` method to the `MemorySystem` class
- Implemented parallel execution of vector search and tag search
- Added configurable weighting for vector and tag search results
- Implemented tag extraction from natural language queries
- Added detailed scoring information in search results

### 4. Testing

We created comprehensive test scripts to verify the implementation:

- Created `test_search.py` to test all search functionality
- Created `add_test_memories.py` to add test memories for testing
- Successfully tested all search functionality with real data

## Technical Details

### Vector Search

The vector search functionality uses sentence transformers for embedding generation and FAISS for efficient similarity search. It returns full memory objects with similarity scores.

```python
def search_vector(self, query: str, limit: int = 10, threshold: float = 0.5) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Search for memories using vector embeddings.
    """
    # Import VectorSearch class
    from creative_lab.memory_system.vector_search import VectorSearch
    
    # Initialize vector search
    vector_search = VectorSearch()
    
    # Perform vector search
    search_results = vector_search.search(query, limit=limit * 2)
    
    # Filter by threshold
    search_results = [r for r in search_results if r.get("score", 0) >= threshold]
    
    # Get full memory objects
    results = []
    for result in search_results:
        path = result.get("path", "")
        if path:
            # Extract memory ID from path
            memory_id = os.path.basename(path).split(".")[0]
            
            # Retrieve the memory
            memory = self.retrieve(memory_id)
            if memory:
                # Add similarity score
                memory["similarity"] = result.get("score", 0)
                results.append(memory)
    
    return results
```

### Tag Search

The tag search functionality supports both simple tag names and "tag:value" format. It returns exact matches with relevance score of 1.0.

```python
def search_by_tag(self, tag_query: str, limit: int = 10) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Search for memories with a specific tag.
    """
    # Parse tag query
    if tag_query.startswith("tag:"):
        # Format: "tag:value"
        tag_value = tag_query.split(":", 1)[1].strip()
        tag = tag_value
    else:
        # Simple tag name
        tag = tag_query
    
    # Check if tag exists
    tag_path = self.tags_dir / f"{tag}.json"
    if not tag_path.exists():
        logger.warning(f"Tag file not found: {tag}")
        return []

    # Load tag data
    with open(tag_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        tag_data = json.load(f)

    # Get memory IDs associated with the tag
    memory_ids = tag_data.get("memories", [])

    # Get the most recent memories
    results = []
    for memory_id in memory_ids[:limit]:
        memory = self.retrieve(memory_id)
        if memory:
            # Add tag relevance score (1.0 for exact tag matches)
            memory["relevance"] = 1.0
            results.append(memory)

    return results
```

### Dual Search

The dual search functionality combines vector search and tag search to provide more comprehensive results. It performs both searches in parallel and combines the results with configurable weights.

```python
def search(
    self,
    query: str,
    limit: int = 10,
    vector_weight: Optional[float] = None,
    tag_weight: Optional[float] = None,
    threshold: float = 0.5
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Perform a dual search using both vector embeddings and relational tags.
    """
    # Perform both searches in parallel using ThreadPoolExecutor
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=2) as executor:
        vector_future = executor.submit(
            self.memory_system.search_vector,
            query,
            limit * 2,
            threshold
        )
        
        # Extract potential tags from the query
        tags = self.extract_tags_from_query(query)
        tag_results = []
        
        # Search for each tag and combine results
        for tag in tags:
            tag_query = f"tag:{tag}"
            tag_future = executor.submit(
                self.memory_system.search_by_tag,
                tag_query,
                limit * 2
            )
            tag_results.extend(tag_future.result())
        
        # Get vector search results
        vector_results = vector_future.result()
    
    # Combine results
    combined_results = {}
    
    # Add vector results
    for result in vector_results:
        memory_id = result.get("id")
        if memory_id:
            combined_results[memory_id] = {
                "memory": result,
                "vector_score": result.get("similarity", 0),
                "tag_score": 0.0,
                "combined_score": vector_weight * result.get("similarity", 0)
            }
    
    # Add tag results
    for result in tag_results:
        memory_id = result.get("id")
        if memory_id:
            if memory_id in combined_results:
                # Update existing result
                combined_results[memory_id]["tag_score"] = result.get("relevance", 0)
                combined_results[memory_id]["combined_score"] += tag_weight * result.get("relevance", 0)
            else:
                # Add new result
                combined_results[memory_id] = {
                    "memory": result,
                    "vector_score": 0.0,
                    "tag_score": result.get("relevance", 0),
                    "combined_score": tag_weight * result.get("relevance", 0)
                }
    
    # Convert to list and sort by combined score
    results_list = list(combined_results.values())
    results_list.sort(key=lambda x: x["combined_score"], reverse=True)
    
    # Limit results
    results_list = results_list[:limit]
    
    # Extract memories and update relevance scores
    memories = []
    for result in results_list:
        memory = result["memory"].copy()
        memory["vector_score"] = result["vector_score"]
        memory["tag_score"] = result["tag_score"]
        memory["combined_score"] = result["combined_score"]
        memory["relevance"] = result["combined_score"]  # Update relevance to combined score
        memories.append(memory)
    
    # Prepare response
    response = {
        "query": query,
        "vector_weight": vector_weight,
        "tag_weight": tag_weight,
        "vector_results_count": len(vector_results),
        "tag_results_count": len(tag_results),
        "combined_results_count": len(memories),
        "results": memories
    }
    
    return response
```

## Issues and Solutions

### 1. Integration with Existing Vector Search

**Issue**: Integrating with the existing `VectorSearch` class from the `creative_lab.memory_system` package.

**Solution**: We imported the `VectorSearch` class in the `search_vector` method and used it to perform vector search. We then extracted the memory IDs from the search results and retrieved the full memory objects.

### 2. Tag Query Parsing

**Issue**: Supporting tag queries in the format "tag:value".

**Solution**: We updated the `search_by_tag` method to parse tag queries in the format "tag:value" and extract the tag value. We also added support for simple tag names.

### 3. Parallel Execution

**Issue**: Performing vector search and tag search in parallel for dual search.

**Solution**: We used the `ThreadPoolExecutor` class from the `concurrent.futures` module to perform both searches in parallel. This improves the performance of dual search by executing both searches concurrently.

### 4. Result Combination

**Issue**: Combining results from vector search and tag search with configurable weights.

**Solution**: We implemented a result combination algorithm that adds vector and tag search results to a combined results dictionary. We then calculated a combined score based on the vector and tag scores, weighted by the configurable weights.

## Next Steps

1. **Improve Vector Search**: Enhance the vector search functionality with more advanced embedding models and search algorithms.

2. **Enhance Tag Search**: Implement more advanced tag search functionality, such as tag hierarchies and tag relationships.

3. **Optimize Dual Search**: Optimize the dual search functionality for better performance and more accurate results.

4. **Add Search UI**: Implement a user interface for searching memories using the different search types.

5. **Implement Search Analytics**: Add analytics for search queries and results to improve search functionality over time.

## Conclusion

The implementation of search functionality enhances the memory system by providing multiple ways to search for memories. The combination of vector search and tag search in the dual search functionality provides a comprehensive search capability that can find memories based on both semantic similarity and structured metadata.

The implementation is flexible, supporting different search types and configurable parameters. It has been thoroughly tested and is ready for use in the Kern Resources project.
