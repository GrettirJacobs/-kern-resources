# Session Summary: Google Gemini Integration with CrewAI

## Date
April 22, 2025

## Overview
In this session, we successfully integrated Google Gemini with CrewAI, focusing on making it work properly with the GUI interface. We identified and fixed issues with the LiteLLM integration that was causing authentication problems when trying to use Google Gemini models.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Fixed Google Gemini Integration**
   - Updated the `llm_helper.py` file to properly handle Google Gemini API keys
   - Added support for both `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variables
   - Configured the integration to use Google AI Studio instead of Vertex AI
   - Added proper model name handling with the correct prefixes

2. **Enhanced Provider Factory**
   - Updated the `provider_factory.py` to support Google Gemini
   - Added environment variable handling for both API key types
   - Forced the use of Google AI Studio to avoid Vertex AI authentication issues

3. **Updated GeminiProvider**
   - Enhanced the existing `gemini_provider.py` to better handle API keys
   - Added explicit configuration to use Google AI Studio
   - Improved error handling and logging

4. **GUI Integration Testing**
   - Tested the API endpoints for creating agents with Google Gemini
   - Verified that the GUI server recognizes and supports Google Gemini
   - Created test agents, tasks, and crews with Google Gemini

## Challenges Encountered

1. **Authentication Issues**
   - LiteLLM was trying to use Vertex AI instead of Google AI Studio
   - Vertex AI requires Google Cloud credentials which weren't available
   - Needed to explicitly configure the environment to use Google AI Studio

2. **API Key Handling**
   - Different parts of the system expected different environment variable names
   - Had to ensure both `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_API_KEY` were set and used correctly

3. **Model Name Prefixes**
   - LiteLLM expects different prefixes for different providers
   - Had to handle both `gemini/` and `google/` prefixes correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Complete GUI Integration Testing**
   - Test running crews with Google Gemini agents
   - Verify that all GUI functionality works with Google Gemini

2. **Multi-Provider Testing**
   - Test scenarios with multiple LLM providers working together
   - Create crews with a mix of Google Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Groq agents

3. **Performance and Cost Monitoring**
   - Implement token usage tracking for Google Gemini
   - Add cost estimation to the dashboard

4. **Advanced Gemini Features**
   - Explore and implement support for Gemini's multimodal capabilities
   - Create examples showcasing Gemini's unique features

## Technical Details

- Google Gemini API requires an API key that can be stored in either `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
- LiteLLM supports Google Gemini through both Vertex AI and Google AI Studio
- For simple API key authentication, Google AI Studio is preferred over Vertex AI
- The environment variable `GOOGLE_AI_STUDIO=true` forces the use of Google AI Studio
- Model names can use either `gemini/` or `google/` prefixes depending on the configuration
