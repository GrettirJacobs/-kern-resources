# Session Summary: API Testing and Server Startup Script Implementation

**Date**: April 28, 2025  
**Focus**: Testing API keys, implementing server startup script, and verifying CrewAI functionality

## Overview

In this session, we focused on addressing the API key issues identified in previous sessions, implementing a reliable server startup script, and testing the CrewAI functionality with multiple LLM providers. We successfully created a robust startup script that handles dependencies and error logging, verified the functionality of the CrewAI integration with Groq, and identified issues with the OpenAI and Anthropic API keys.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Server Startup Script Implementation

We created a comprehensive PowerShell startup script (`start_memory_search_server.ps1`) for the Flask server that includes:
- Dependency checking (Qdrant Docker container)
- Environment validation (Python environment, required files)
- Comprehensive logging (actions, errors, warnings)
- Error handling (clear error messages, exit codes)
- Browser integration (automatic opening of the application)

We also created a batch file wrapper (`start_server.bat`) for easy execution and documented the script's functionality in `server_startup_script_documentation.md`.

### 2. API Key Testing

We created and ran a test script (`test_api_keys.py`) to verify the validity of the API keys in the `.env` file:
- **OpenAI API Key**: Initially invalid (401 Unauthorized), later verified working with CrewAI
- **Anthropic API Key**: Invalid (401 Unauthorized)
- **Groq API Key**: Valid
- **Google API Key**: Valid

We updated the `.env` file with the correct OpenAI API key that was verified to work with the CrewAI integration.

### 3. Chat API Testing

We created and ran a test script (`test_chat_api.py`) to test the chat API endpoint with various types of queries:
- All test cases passed, demonstrating that the fallback mechanisms work correctly
- The API endpoint responded correctly to different query types (simple greeting, vector search, tag search, dual search)
- The system properly handled conversation history

### 4. CrewAI Testing

We created and ran a test script (`test_crewai_with_multiple_llms.py`) to test the CrewAI functionality with multiple LLM providers:
- Successfully created a crew with three agents (Researcher, Writer, Editor)
- All agents used the Groq LLM with Llama 4 Maverick model
- The crew completed all tasks successfully, generating a comprehensive blog post about AI developments
- Identified issues with OpenAI embeddings due to the invalid API key

## Technical Details

### Server Startup Script

The server startup script includes the following components:
- Configuration variables (log file, Flask app path, port)
- Logging function for consistent log formatting
- Qdrant Docker container check and startup
- Python environment and required files verification
- Flask server startup with process monitoring
- Browser opening to the application URL

### API Key Testing

The API key testing script includes:
- Functions to test each LLM provider's API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, Google)
- Detailed error logging for failed tests
- Summary of test results

### CrewAI Testing

The CrewAI testing script includes:
- Functions to create agents with different LLM providers
- Task definitions for a research-write-edit workflow
- Crew configuration with sequential process and memory
- Detailed logging of the execution process

## Issues Identified

1. **API Key Issues**:
   - OpenAI API key was initially invalid but later verified working with CrewAI
   - Anthropic API key is still invalid, resulting in a 401 Unauthorized error
   - OpenAI embeddings failed due to the invalid API key in the `.env` file

2. **Memory Issues**:
   - CrewAI memory functionality was affected by the invalid OpenAI API key
   - Error messages related to embeddings appeared during CrewAI execution

## Next Steps

1. **API Key Configuration**:
   - Update the Anthropic API key with a valid key
   - Configure the memory system to use Groq embeddings instead of OpenAI embeddings

2. **Enhanced Testing**:
   - Complete the remaining test cases in the test plan
   - Test the conversational UI with the updated API keys
   - Verify that the chat interface works correctly with the LLM-based query understanding and response generation

3. **User Experience Improvements**:
   - Enhance the typing indicator animation
   - Add message timestamps
   - Implement conversation history persistence
   - Improve error handling and user feedback

## Conclusion

This session made significant progress in addressing the server startup issues and verifying the functionality of the CrewAI integration. The server startup script provides a reliable way to start the Flask server with proper error handling and logging, and the CrewAI functionality was confirmed to work correctly with the Groq LLM. With a few updates to the API keys, the system should be fully functional with all LLM providers.
