**Steps**:
1. Open the memory search page at http://localhost:5001
2. Enter a simple query in the chat input field (e.g., "Hello")
3. Click the Send button or press Enter

**Expected Results**:
- User message appears in the chat history
- Typing indicator is displayed
- AI response is received and displayed
- Conversation history is updated

### Test Case 1.2: Conversation History Management

**Description**: Verify that conversation history is maintained correctly.

**Steps**:
1. Send multiple messages in sequence
2. Refresh the page
3. Send a follow-up message

**Expected Results**:
- All messages are displayed in the correct order
- Conversation context is maintained between messages
- After refresh, conversation history is reset (current behavior)

### Test Case 1.3: Typing Indicator

**Description**: Verify that the typing indicator works correctly.

**Steps**:
1. Send a message
2. Observe the typing indicator
3. Wait for the response

**Expected Results**:
- Typing indicator appears immediately after sending a message
- Typing indicator is animated
- Typing indicator disappears when the response is received

## 2. Search Integration

### Test Case 2.1: Vector Search

**Description**: Verify that vector search queries work correctly.

**Steps**:
1. Send a query that would trigger vector search (e.g., "Tell me about healthcare resources")
2. Observe the search results

**Expected Results**:
- Search query field is updated with the query
- Vector search radio button is selected
- Search results are displayed
- AI response references the search results

### Test Case 2.2: Tag Search

**Description**: Verify that tag-based search queries work correctly.

**Steps**:
1. Send a query that would trigger tag search (e.g., "Show me resources with the healthcare tag")
2. Observe the search results

**Expected Results**:
- Search query field is updated with the query
- Tag search radio button is selected
- Search results are displayed
- AI response references the search results

### Test Case 2.3: Dual Search

**Description**: Verify that dual search queries work correctly.

**Steps**:
1. Send a query that would trigger dual search (e.g., "Find healthcare resources in Bakersfield")
2. Observe the search results

**Expected Results**:
- Search query field is updated with the query
- Dual search radio button is selected
- Search results are displayed
- AI response references the search results

## 3. Error Handling

### Test Case 3.1: API Key Errors

**Description**: Verify that the system handles API key errors gracefully.

**Steps**:
1. Modify the `.env` file to include an invalid API key
2. Restart the server
3. Send a message

**Expected Results**:
- System falls back to rule-based query understanding
- System falls back to template-based response generation
- User receives a meaningful response
- Error is logged appropriately

### Test Case 3.2: Empty Queries

**Description**: Verify that the system handles empty queries correctly.

**Steps**:
1. Click the Send button without entering a message
2. Press Enter without entering a message

**Expected Results**:
- No message is sent
- No error is displayed
- Input field remains focused

### Test Case 3.3: Long Queries

**Description**: Verify that the system handles long queries correctly.

**Steps**:
1. Enter a very long query (500+ characters)
2. Click the Send button

**Expected Results**:
- Message is sent and displayed correctly
- Message is truncated in the display if necessary
- System processes the query correctly

## 4. User Experience

### Test Case 4.1: Responsive Design

**Description**: Verify that the chat interface is responsive.

**Steps**:
1. Open the memory search page on different screen sizes
2. Resize the browser window
3. Use the chat interface

**Expected Results**:
- Chat interface adapts to different screen sizes
- All elements remain usable and visible
- No layout issues or overlapping elements

### Test Case 4.2: Accessibility

**Description**: Verify that the chat interface is accessible.

**Steps**:
1. Navigate the interface using keyboard only
2. Test with screen reader
3. Check color contrast

**Expected Results**:
- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Screen reader can announce all elements
- Color contrast meets WCAG standards

### Test Case 4.3: Visual Feedback

**Description**: Verify that the chat interface provides appropriate visual feedback.

**Steps**:
1. Hover over interactive elements
2. Click on interactive elements
3. Send messages and observe feedback

**Expected Results**:
- Hover states are visible
- Click states are visible
- Sending a message provides visual feedback

## 5. Performance

### Test Case 5.1: Response Time

**Description**: Verify that the chat interface responds within acceptable time limits.

**Steps**:
1. Send a simple query
2. Send a complex query
3. Send multiple queries in quick succession

**Expected Results**:
- Simple queries receive responses within 2 seconds
- Complex queries receive responses within 5 seconds
- System handles multiple queries without degradation

### Test Case 5.2: Memory Usage

**Description**: Verify that the chat interface does not consume excessive memory.

**Steps**:
1. Send multiple messages in a long conversation
2. Monitor memory usage in browser developer tools

**Expected Results**:
- Memory usage remains stable
- No memory leaks
- Performance does not degrade over time

## Test Execution

### Test Environment Setup

1. Start the Qdrant Docker container
2. Update the `.env` file with valid API keys
3. Start the Flask server using the startup script
4. Open the memory search page in the browser

### Test Execution Procedure

1. Execute each test case in the order listed
2. Document the results of each test case
3. Note any deviations from expected behavior
4. Capture screenshots of any issues

### Test Reporting

Create a test report that includes:
1. Test case ID
2. Test case description
3. Test result (Pass/Fail)
4. Actual behavior
5. Screenshots (if applicable)
6. Notes and observations

## Conclusion

This test plan provides a comprehensive approach to testing the conversational UI implementation. By following this plan, we can ensure that the chat interface works correctly, integrates properly with the search functionality, handles errors gracefully, provides a good user experience, and performs well under various conditions.
