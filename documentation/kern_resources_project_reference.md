# Kern Resources Project Reference

This document provides a comprehensive reference for the Kern Resources project, including its purpose, architecture, development history, and current focus. It is designed to be used as a reference in future development sessions.

## Project Purpose

Kern Resources is a comprehensive resource management system with advanced memory capabilities and AI-driven interfaces. It is designed to help resource managers, community service providers, social workers, healthcare professionals, and educational institutions efficiently store, retrieve, and analyze information about community resources.

Key features include:
- Novel four-layer memory system for storing and retrieving information
- Dual search capabilities (vector and tag-based)
- CrewAI integration for complex task handling
- AI-driven conversational interface
- Excel data integration for real-world resources

## Novel Memory System

The project features a novel four-layer memory architecture:

1. **Layer 1: Exact Duplicates**
   - Raw storage of original content without modification
   - Implemented using Qdrant collection 'exact_storage'
   - Purpose: Preserve original information exactly as received

2. **Layer 2: Machine-Readable Tags**
   - Structured metadata and tags for efficient retrieval
   - Implemented using Qdrant collection 'memory_tags'
   - Purpose: Enable precise filtering and categorization

3. **Layer 3: AI Summaries**
   - AI-generated summaries and analyses of content
   - Implemented using OpenAI GPT models for analysis
   - Purpose: Provide condensed, insightful views of information

4. **Layer 4: AI Meta-Commentaries**
   - Higher-level insights about patterns across multiple memories
   - Implemented using Anthropic Claude models for meta-analysis
   - Purpose: Identify connections and patterns across the knowledge base

The memory system supports three search methods:
- **Vector Search**: Semantic similarity-based search using embeddings
- **Tag Search**: Filtering by metadata tags and attributes
- **Dual Search**: Combined approach using both vector and tag search

## Tools Integration

- **Tools**:
  - Excel data processing
  - Memory system integration
  - Web crawling (planned)
  - Document handling (planned)

### Agent2Agent (A2A)

- Purpose: Enable sophisticated communication between AI agents
- Implementation: Adaptation of Google's A2A framework
- Status: Planned for future integration

### Vector Database

- Name: Qdrant
- Purpose: Store and retrieve vector embeddings for semantic search
- Implementation: Local Qdrant instance with collections for each memory layer

### Embedding Models

- Name: Sentence Transformers
- Model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2
- Vector Size: 384
- Purpose: Generate embeddings for semantic search
